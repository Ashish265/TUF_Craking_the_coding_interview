Set Matrix Zero
Problem Statement: Given a matrix if an element in the matrix is 0 then you will have to set its entire column and row to 0 
and then return the matrix.

Examples 1:

Input: matrix=[[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]

Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Explanation: Since matrix[2][2]=0.Therfore the 2nd column and 2nd row wil be set to 0.
 
Input: matrix=[[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]

Output:[[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

Explanation:Since matrix[0][0]=0 and matrix[0][3]=0. Therefore 1st row, 1st column and 4th column will be set to 0

    for j in range(m):
        if matrix[i][j] != 0:
            matrix[i][j] = -1

                markCol(matrix, n, m, j)
    
    # Finally, mark all -1 as 0:
    for i in range(n):

            if matrix[i][j] == -1:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

# Example usage
matt = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
n = len(matt)
m = len(matt[0])
print(zeroMatrix(matt,n,m))  # Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
